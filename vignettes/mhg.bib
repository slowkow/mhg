  abstract    = "Computational methods for discovery of sequence elements that
                 are enriched in a target set compared with a background set
                 are fundamental in molecular biology research. One example is
                 the discovery of transcription factor binding motifs that are
                 inferred from ChIP-chip (chromatin immuno-precipitation on a
                 microarray) measurements. Several major challenges in sequence
                 motif discovery still require consideration: (i) the need for
                 a principled approach to partitioning the data into target and
                 background sets; (ii) the lack of rigorous models and of an
                 exact p-value for measuring motif enrichment; (iii) the need
                 for an appropriate framework for accounting for motif
                 multiplicity; (iv) the tendency, in many of the existing
                 methods, to report presumably significant motifs even when
                 applied to randomly generated data. In this paper we present a
                 statistical framework for discovering enriched sequence
                 elements in ranked lists that resolves these four issues. We
                 demonstrate the implementation of this framework in a software
                 application, termed DRIM (discovery of rank imbalanced
                 motifs), which identifies sequence motifs in lists of ranked
                 DNA sequences. We applied DRIM to ChIP-chip and CpG
                 methylation data and obtained the following results. (i)
                 Identification of 50 novel putative transcription factor (TF)
                 binding sites in yeast ChIP-chip data. The biological function
                 of some of them was further investigated to gain new insights
                 on transcription regulation networks in yeast. For example,
                 our discoveries enable the elucidation of the network of the
                 TF ARO80. Another finding concerns a systematic TF binding
                 enhancement to sequences containing CA repeats. (ii) Discovery
                 of novel motifs in human cancer CpG methylation data.
                 Remarkably, most of these motifs are similar to DNA sequence
                 elements bound by the Polycomb complex that promotes histone
                 methylation. Our findings thus support a model in which
                 histone methylation and CpG methylation are mechanistically
                 linked. Overall, we demonstrate that the statistical framework
                 embodied in the DRIM software tool is highly effective for
                 identifying regulatory sequence elements in a variety of
                 applications ranging from expression and ChIP-chip to CpG
                 methylation data. DRIM is publicly available at

  title    = "{GO-PCA}: An Unsupervised Method to Explore Biological
              Heterogeneity Based on Gene Expression and Prior Knowledge",
  author   = "Wagner, Florian",
  abstract = "Genome-wide expression profiling is a cost-efficient and widely
              used method to characterize heterogeneous populations of cells,
              tissues, biopsies, or other biological specimen. The exploratory
              analysis of such datasets typically relies on generic
              unsupervised methods, e.g. principal component analysis or
              hierarchical clustering. However, generic methods fail to exploit
              the significant amount of knowledge that exists about the
              molecular functions of genes. Here, I introduce GO-PCA, an
              unsupervised method that incorporates prior knowledge about gene
              functions in the form of gene ontology (GO) annotations. GO-PCA
              aims to discover and represent biological heterogeneity along all
              major axes of variation in a given dataset, while suppressing
              heterogeneity due to technical biases. To this end, GO-PCA
              combines principal component analysis (PCA) with nonparametric GO
              enrichment analysis, and uses the results to generate expression
              signatures based on small sets of functionally related genes. I
              first applied GO-PCA to expression data from diverse lineages of
              the human hematopoietic system, and obtained a small set of
              signatures that captured known cell characteristics for most
              lineages. I then applied the method to expression profiles of
              glioblastoma (GBM) tumor biopsies, and obtained signatures that
              were strongly associated with multiple previously described GBM
              subtypes. Surprisingly, GO-PCA discovered a cell cycle-related
              signature that exhibited significant differences between the
              Proneural and the prognostically favorable GBM CpG Island
              Methylator (G-CIMP) subtypes, suggesting that the G-CIMP subtype
              is characterized in part by lower mitotic activity. Previous
              expression-based classifications have failed to separate these
              subtypes, demonstrating that GO-PCA can detect heterogeneity that
              is missed by other methods. My results show that GO-PCA is a
              powerful and versatile expression-based method that facilitates
              exploration of large-scale expression data, without requiring
              additional types of experimental data. The low-dimensional
              representation generated by GO-PCA lends itself to
              interpretation, hypothesis generation, and further analysis.",

                 the significant enrichments and/or depletions of GO categories
                 among a class of genes of interest. Whereas a correct
                 formulation of the problem leads to a single exact null
                 distribution, these GO tools use a large variety of
                 statistical tests whose denominations often do not clarify the
                 underlying P-value computations. SUMMARY: We review the
                 different formulations of the problem and the tests they lead
                 to: the binomial, chi2, equality of two probabilities,
                 Fisher's exact and hypergeometric tests. We clarify the
                 relationships existing between these tests, in particular the
                 equivalence between the hypergeometric test and Fisher's exact
                 test. We recall that the other tests are valid only for large
                 samples, the test of equality of two probabilities and the
                 chi2-test being equivalent. We discuss the appropriateness of
                 one- and two-sided P-values, as well as some discreteness and
                 conservatism issues. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary
